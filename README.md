# Explorable Explanations with Markdown

This repo shows how easy it is to create [explorable explanations](http://explorabl.es/) with markdown.

This project uses the [`markdown-it-component`](https://github.com/ccorcos/markdown-it-component) plugin and the [`markdown-it-renderer`](https://github.com/ccorcos/markdown-it-renderer) to allow you to render React components using a new syntax `[ComponentName]{prop: "value"}`. This makes it much easier to write long-form content with interactive bits litered throughout.
