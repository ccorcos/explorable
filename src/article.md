# Explorable Markdown Demo

This repo demonstrates the use [`markdown-it-component`](https://github.com/ccorcos/markdown-it-component) and [`markdown-it-renderer`](https://github.com/ccorcos/markdown-it-renderer) to write articles with Markdown using a custom syntax to render components within the article.

# Examples

- Render a component:

	[Counter]{}

- Render a component with props:

	[Counter]{delta: 10}

- Create [Tangle-like](http://worrydream.com/Tangle/) interactive components.

	> If you put $[Invest]{} per month into a 401K that makes [Interest]{}% interest, then after [Time]{} years, you'll have [Total]{}!

- Embed rich interactive media into your documents.

	[ColorPicker]{}

	[ColorSwatch]{}
